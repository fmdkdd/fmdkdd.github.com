title: Effort Versus Value
---

An opposition I encounter regularly, and one that still bothers me.

Effort is how I would measure my own work: how much I put into it, and how much
I think I have achieved.  But others cannot measure this effort; they can only
measure the work’s value for them.  Hence, the creator and the audience have
opposite objectives.

Examples abound:
- cooking your own cake.  It tastes better, even if it’s actually worse than the
  store-bought cake.  That’s because you made it.  Effort is its own reward, and
  the pleasure to eat the fruit of your effort greatly surpasses the pleasure to
  eat the cake.
- selling games.  An indie developer releases her game after 5 years of hard
  work and commensurable abnegation.  She measures her effort, and prices the
  game at $X in order to recoup her losses and make enough profit to fund her
  next project.  But $X is too high for some gamers, because they only measure
  what the game is worth to /them/.
- students grades.  We should encourage effort, but we only measure value.  Game
  theory teaches us that students will then /minimize/ the effort and maximize
  the perceived value of their work.  Disheartening.
- writing papers, where all that counts is the perceived *value* of your
  contribution, and not how long you worked on it.
- After defending my PhD, nothing was more irritating than relatives
  congrulating me on obtaining the diploma.  I couldn't care less about the
  dipploma, about what is signaled.  The day before I got it, I was 99.999% the
  same person, who had been working on this for 4 years.  The day after, some
  people got together in a room and decided to flip a switch, but I still felt
  the same.

Any creative activity that is then evaluated is subject to this opposition.  The
evaluators measure the utility of the work, while the creators measure their
effort in creating it.  It pains me to say that evaluators have good reasons:
they often want something, and they’d rather take the best thing for them than
the one that took the most effort.  There is no value in effort for the
audience.

I wonder if emphasizing value is a good social policy.  It leads to minimizing
effort in order to produce the largest amount of value.  On the other hand,
rewarding effort would probably lead to maximizing effort, regardless of the
value of the end result.

Then there is the matter of actually /measuring/ effort.  We can’t measure what
counts, so we count what we can measure?
