Games that teach us something, useful skills or life lessons.

Most games teach hand-eye coordination.  That's almost a prerequisite.  Flying
simulators have proved to be effictive at teaching people coordination and
orientation.

But I'm more interested in games that teach us humanistic skills.

Also, just playing these games might not net you the mentioned skills.  But
getting good at them will have these side effects.

- The Witness teaches the player to be mindful of his surroundings.  To look for
  patterns in the world, and to induce the rules governing puzzles.  It's a game
  of and about epiphanies.

- Braid teaches the player to think about time.  There is a lesson about
  letting go of seeking knowledge, but it's not the most eloquent formulation.

- Minecraft teaches the player to set their own goals.  The "arcade" experience
  is weak: combat has been done better elsewhere, exploration is repetitive once
  you have seen all the biomes.  But the true value proposition is in the
  ability to rearrange the whole world, cube by cube.  You can do anything, but
  you have to use your creativity.

  Also, due to its popularity, Minecraft has a vibrant multiplayer experience,
  which bring about other lessons.  Cue the story of the girl who manipulated
  the economy of a Minecraft server.

- World of Warcraft teaches player to work with others.  Maybe there's a better
  representative for that (EVE Online?), as modern WoW has smoothed out the
  friction of dealing with other players.  But classic WoW contains important
  life lessons about sharing and inter-personal communication.

  Being a raid lead in classic WoW is a curriculum-worthy skill.

- Pikmin, like other RTSs, teaches you to multi-task.  While you send your red
  Pikmins to attack the goomba, you send your yellow Pikmins up the hill to pick
  up later.  You have to plan, and execute that plan in time, because there is a
  day timer and a global game timer.

  But unlike most RTSs, it's not about outsmarting your opponent.  It's about
  being the most efficient: finishing the game requires executing your plan
  fast.  Keeping Pikmins alive requires quick thinking and deft execution.

  There's also an ecological lesson about taking care of your planet, and
  breeding sympathy for social insects.

- Mario Maker teaches player how to design a game.

- SimCity, like other tycoon games, teaches you how to hold a budget.  You could
  say that SimCity can help you realize what it takes to run a city.
  Unfortunately, applying the rules that grant success in SimCity will fall
  short in real life.

  It does teach you about repercussions, and systems thinking, but there might
  be better representative of its equivalence class.

- Creatures is in a unique game space.  It has very interesting systems, but it
  doesn't teach you much though.

- Tetris!

I'm not talking about: games that are important historically, or games that are
excellent experiences.  I'm more interested in systems than in stories.
