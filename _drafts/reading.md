For the longest time, I believed that reading a book would make me smarter.  The
reasoning might have went a little like this:

1. books are written by smart folks;
2. their writing is distilled smart-stuff;
3. reading their prose is like drinking smart-full nutrients;
4. like absorbed nutrients fuel my body, absorbing words with my eyes fuels my
   brain;
5. thus, reading their words makes me smarter.

QED.

Now, you might object to assumptions #1 and #2, and, in an all my *naïveté*, I
*was* aware that these did not hold for all litterature known to mankind.  Or
rather, I suspected that books came in varying levels of quality, which in turn
translated into more or less efficient knowledge absorption.  To keep the
culinary analogy going, some books were like fast-food: cheap and full of fat
sugars to give you a short but high thrill, while others were more like
*féculents*: less thrilling, but more fulfilling for a day's work.  In a sane
diet, you want less of the former, and more of the latter; I wanted a sane
*reading* diet.  *Corpore sano*.

A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that the number of books one can
reasonably manage to read in a lifetime has been eclipsed by the number of books
in circulation has surpassed somewhere around ... three centuries ago.  Clearly,
in order to quench my thirst of knowledge, I would need to devise a system to
part the wheat from the chaff.

From an early age, I caught on that *recommendations* were an effective
solution.  I have a simple formula: the likelihood of me reading a book is
proportional to the number of times that book was recommended to me (directly by
a friend, or indirectly through word of mouth), weighted by the area of overlap
between the source of the recommendation's center of interests and mine.  In
other words, if we both are passionate about waffles, and there's this book you
just read that's all about waffology, then the likelihood of me finding a copy
to read it is very high.  On the other hand, if we have nothing in common, then
chances are low that I will get out of my way to find that copy of "All About
Sophie" you keep raving about.  Of course, other factors may come into play, and
I do not actually carry out calculations to rank books that were recommended to
me in order to pick one to read.  But as a rule of them, I do get good mileage
out of this formula, even when applied to other things like films, videogames
and music.

A second point is the nature of the book itself.  Some books have explicit
pedagological value: textbooks, scientific articles, encyclopedias, user manuals
and the like.  It is easy to see how one could want to "download" all their
factual contents directly into one's brain.  Other kinds of books, like fiction,
have a different value proposition: they primarily entertain you with a gripping
story.  One may then question the usefulness of cramming one's head with the
intricacies of Bridget Jones' failings at finding love.  Aside from the trivial
observation that, yes, sometimes, it is *good* to be entertained, even by
clichés, I'd argue that even fictional writings may hold valuable insights,
often in the form of analogies.  Roman and Greek mythology is rife with
relatable situations; reading these is enriching an arsenal of anecdotes, one
for each situation.

Now, once with the question of selecting books worth to read for their knowledge
out of the way, I want to touch on the *consequences* that the belief I opened
with brings about.

- I read books from front to back, without missing a letter.  Footnotes and
  back-cover blurb included.  I was once appalled at a fellow student who
  revealed to me that her so-called speed-reading technique involved skipping
  *whole paragraphs*.  I couldn't bear the thought of missing out some *great
  jewel of knowledge* at the turn of a sentence.  Like gold searchers
  (aurosomethings?), I carefully sieved through each page, in search of nuggets
  of wisdoms.
- This lead into an unhealthy fixation on *quotes*.  I got a quote dictionary:
  that's a book with quotes for every word.  Wisdom for every situation!  Each
  quote was seemingly very profound, solemnous in its brevity—the shorter the
  quote, the stronger its impact.

  Much later, I realized that quotes drawed a lot of their power from their
  vacuity.  Like horoscopes, quotes thrive not because of what they actually
  say, but because of what we read into them.

  Much of their power was also lost when I tried to match quotes to their
  context, in a hopeless quest to make them shine brighter.  With their proper
  context, quotes often lose their lustre when you realize that the author was
  actually talking about a very specific thing that's irrelevant today.  You
  also quickly lose the will to use a quote when you find out that its context
  is apologies of racism.

- Once, I figured that I could expand my vocabulary tremendously by reading the
  dictionary, cover to cover.  Being somewhat less diligent than ambitious, that
  attempt ended before reaching ‘abscons’.

- I was deeply envious of the Junior Woodchuck manual.  This encyclopedic little
  tome seemingly contained all the answers to all the questions one could ever
  ask.

  At University, I started writing an encyclopedia of data structures.  Its sole
  article was, and still is, the Linked List.

  Well, since then, Wikipedia emerged.

- Reading encyclopedia

- It led to believe there was an *objective meaning* to any book, one single
  interpretation of fiction that could be agreed upon.  Often, the one
  interpretation intended by the author.

But mostly, I was surprised to see that my observations did not match my theory.

After reading a book about Artificial Intelligence, I was objectively incapable
of *writing* the same book.  If I had absorbed this knowledge, then surely I
would be able to?

And what about books which I had difficulties reading?  Was I hoping that, when
I finally got to the end, after clutching my way through the tortuous sentences
and unfamiliar jargon, I would be enlightened?

And what about re-reading books?  Surely, from the theory one would conclude
that re-reading books would be a clear waste of time.  But surprisingly, it
wasn't?  Even worse, when re-reading books, I would find some *other* insights,
other knowledge that I had previously missed, or misinterpreted.  Except it
wasn't really misinterpretation.

Now, as a grown child with facial hair, I have a another point of view.

Books can only teach you what you can get out of them.  That sounds vacuous, but
it emphasizes one key point: the reader own knowledge determines the outcome as
much as the sequence of words in the book.  There's an interplay between both.
My experience of reading *Thinking Forth*, and what I will retain from it, may
be vastly different from yours.

I realized that after reading the words off the page, the process of digesting
them mostly feels like a reorganization of thought.  The words need to be
integrated with my own mental organization.  It feels like introducing a
stranger into some long standing fellowship.  There is an established dynamic
that's clearly working, and the stranger will have to learn that dynamic in
order to fit in.  Same with this foreign-knowledge-bearing words.  Their
concepts must adapt to the way my mental models are already set up.  And this
osmosis is an irremediable alteration of the book contents.



It's a simple explanation.  Like ancient tribes that believed that eating the
brain of your enemy would give you his knowledge, or that eating his calves
would make you run faster.

Simple theories are the scaffolding we use to grow.  Once we shed them away, we
turn to other, more sophisticated and nuanced theories that overcome the
previous one's shortcomings.

Shed after shed, we catch ever-growing glimpses of the full picture, until we
abruptly die.
