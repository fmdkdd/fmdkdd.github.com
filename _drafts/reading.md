title: On Reading
---

I love learning new things, potentially more than *knowing* things.  I'm talking
about big, meaningful things: concepts, systems, algorithms.  I'm interested in
understanding how the universe works, but not necessarily what you had for
dinner yesterday.

Much of that precious knowledge I seek, I get from reading.  Nowadays, reading
comes in many different flavors; books of course, but also journals, magazines,
comics, websites, pages, blogs, forums... While some of these differ in purpose,
it's still pretty much text; for this particular discussion, it doesn't matter
if the ray of lights that carry the words to your retina come from a computer
monitor, a phone, or a candle.  So, for this post, I will use the word *book* to
refer to any word source.  Because it rings better than "text".  Book.  Boo-ook.
BOOK!

This post is about reading books.

### A naive start

When I was growing up, I did not have many friends (well I still don't, but that
may be a topic for another day).  Part of the reason was a shyness bordering on
the pathological, but maybe another cause was that I *did* (and still do) enjoy
a quiet solitude.  While other children gleefully sportsballed outside, I
favoured playind *in my mind* rather than in the physical world.  And until I
found a computer keyboard in my hands, reading was certainly my favorite
activity.

For the longest time, I believed that the sole act of reading books would make
me smarter.  The reasoning might have went a bit like this:

1. books are written by smart folks;
2. their writing distills smart-stuff into words;
3. reading their prose is like drinking smart-full nutrients;
4. like absorbed nutrients fuel my body, absorbing words with my eyes fuels my
   brain;
5. thus, reading their words makes me smarter.  QED.

But, mainly, it might just have been the social stigma that book worms lean more
easily toward knowledge-oriented jobs.

Now, while I have mostly outgrown this belief, it has impacted many of my past
reading behavior.  I want to reminisce on some of its most embarassing
consequences later, but first I want to discuss its hypotheses.

### Finding the good books

You might object to assumptions #1 and #2, and, in an all my *naïveté*, I *was*
aware that these did not hold for all litterature known to mankind; i.e., not
all books may be worth reading.  Or rather, I suspected that books came in
varying levels of quality, which in turn meant various amount of knowledge to
absorb.  To keep the culinary analogy going, some books are like fast-food:
cheap and full of saturated fat and sugars to give you a short but potent high,
while others are more like *légumes*: less thrilling, but more nutritious.  In a
healthy diet, you want less of the former, and more of the latter.  *Mens sana
in corpore sano* calls for a healthy *reading* diet.

A [quick back-of-the-envelope calculation](https://what-if.xkcd.com/76/) shows
that the number of books one can reasonably manage to read in a lifetime has
been eclipsed by the number of books in circulation since around ... five
centuries ago.  Clearly, in my eternal quest of wisdom, I would need to devise a
system to part the wheat from the chaff.

From an early age, I caught on that *recommendations* were an effective
solution.  I have a simple formula: the likelihood of me reading a book is
proportional to the number of times that book was recommended to me (directly by
a friend, or indirectly through word of mouth), weighted by the area of overlap
between the recommender's interests and mine.  In other words, if we both are
passionate about waffles, and you tell me about this book on Belgian wafflology
after the first World War, then the likelihood of me reading it is very high.
On the other hand, if have diverging interests, then chances are low that I will
get out of my way to find a copy of that *Shoelace Makers of the Renaissance*
you keep raving about (even though it does sound a little intriguing!).  But if
I keep hearing about it, I just might get one.  Of course, other factors come
into play, and I do not actually carry out calculations to rank books that were
recommended to me in order to pick one to read.  But even loosely applied, I do
get good mileage out of this formula; and it can be extended to other media like
films, videogames and music.

Also of importance is the nature of the book.  Some books have explicit
pedagological value: textbooks, scientific articles, historic treaties,
encyclopedias, user manuals and the like.  It is easy to see how one could want
to download all their factual contents directly into one's brain.  Other kinds
of books, like fiction, have a different value proposition: they primarily
entertain you with a gripping story.  One may then question the utilify of
cramming one's head with the intricacies of Bridget Jones' failings at finding
love.  Aside from the trivial observation that, yes, sometimes, it *is* good to
be entertained, even by clichés, I'd argue that even fictional writings may hold
valuable insights.  Stories have a way of making a mark in our collective
imagery, and their characters can often be used in daily conversations to draw
one's point home more vividly.  Greek mythology is rife with figures whose
actions gave us useful analogies and even common words: Odysseus' sirens,
Icarus' flight, Tantalus' punishment, Narcissus' fatal narcissism, Sisyphus'
sisyphean plight, *etc.*

All of that to say that while I favor reading technical books because they will
more often hold actionable knowledge, other literary pursuits may still be
worthwhile for expanding my horizons, or even just for fun.

### Reading habits

Now, having no shortage of wonderful books to discover, I want to reflect on
behaviors that may have been brought about by that forementioned belief.

I used to read books from front to back, without missing a letter.  Footnotes
and back-cover blurb included.  Carefully sieving each page, in search of
nuggets of wisdoms.  I was once appalled at a fellow student who revealed to me
that her so-called speed-reading technique involved skipping *whole paragraphs*.
I couldn't bear the thought of glancing over a sentence in fear of missing out
some important tidbit; skipping paragraphs was heresy.

Nowadays, I skip by leaps and bounds when the text does not seem to be relevant
to what I'm after.  Though I tend to read fiction at a more leisurely pace,
perhaps because there, half of the delight is in the composition of the words.
Textbooks may be engaging, but their prose is too often stifling.

I had an unhealthy fixation on *quotes*.  Assuredly, quotes contained the words
that were the most potent, the most meaningful of the book they came from,
otherwise they wouldn't be worth quoting!  I was fascinated by the mysterious
force of some quotes that are part of the vernacular, passed down generation
after generation to be used as thought-terminating clichés around Christmas
dinner.

I got a quote dictionary: that's a book with quotes for every word.  Two quotes
for "city", three quotes for "lion".  One quote for every occasion.  Each quote
was seemingly very profound, solemnous in its brevity—the shorter the quote, the
stronger its impact.  My agenda even had quotes for each day; one was simply:

> D'oh!
>
> — Homer Simpson

Over time, I realized that quotes drew most of their power from two sources:
their author, and their generality.  Quoting famous figures is an effective way
to [argue from authority][]. And, like horoscopes, quotes thrive not because of
what they actually say, but because of what we read into them.

Their effects started to wane when I tried to match quotes to their context.
Often quotes lose their luster when you realize that their point is made
better by the surrounding paragraphs of the text that harbor them.  You come
to appreciate the intricacies and nuances of the author's argument, rather
than cargo-cult on just one cherry-picked sentence.

I still like a good quote, especially when their relevance to the text is [not
obvious][cheeky-quote].

### Quixotic quests for knowledge

Once upon a time, I imagined that I could expand my vocabulary tremendously by
reading the dictionary cover to cover.  Mind you, I must have been around ten.
Having somewhat more ambition than diligence, that attempt ended before reaching
the word ‘abacus’.

Still, I clinged to the prospect of absorbing knowledge from such ponderous
volumes.

I ardently coveted the [Junior Woodchucks' Guidebook][the-book].  This
encyclopedic little tome seemingly contained all the answers to all the
questions one could ever ask.  Alas, it was fictional.  Remember that there
was no Wikipedia; and no Internet access.  But we did have encyclopedias.

The one we had was a sort of insidious scam.  Initially, you would just buy a
magazine containing a few interesting articles.  These articles you could
detach, and they came with punched holes to conveniently put them in binder.
But then, you had a large binder with just a handful of articles, and a child
with a consuming curiosity, so what did you do?  You bought a subscription to
receive more articles every week in the mail.  Each Tuesday, I would get a new
batch of fresh knowledge; I fondly remember reading about a wide range of
topics, from medieval conflicts to relativity, from sound waves to giraffes.
After reading, I would dutifully transfer the articles to the binder, putting
each one in its proper category.  Initially, the costs were low, but they slowly
accrued to amounts that probably matched the price of a twenty-volumes
encyclopedia.  As months went by, the binder grew larger, and soon a new one was
needed.  Of course, the publishing house also sold official binders for a pretty
penny.  We ended the subscription after I had filled my fifth binder.

Even though it occupied a whole shelf, and thus was roughly ten times larger
than the Woodchucks' Guidebook, it was obvious that it did *not*, in fact,
contain [the sum knowledge of all humanity][alexandria].  Reality crushed the
magic of the Guidebook, but the idea of a tome containing all the answers never
really left me.

At University I was fascinated with data structures.  They have the elegance
of simplicity on the outside, and the beauty of intricacies on the inside.  It
seemed they were crucial to solving many fundamental problems in computer
science, and as I wanted to become the very best, I had to catch them all.

I started compiling all the information I could find in a personal
encyclopedia.  I documented their applications, their big-oh complexity,
tradeoffs of implementation.  My goal was for it to be the one place of
reference I would ever need for all my curriculum.

Its sole article was, and still is, the Linked List.

After that, I realized that exhaustivity of information was not only
inachievable, but it was often indesirable.  For informative books to be useful,
they need to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio; they must focus on the
essential and forget trivia.

### Counterexamples

While these events did alter my perception of knowledge and its acquisition,
they did not altogether dispel my belief that reading alone would grant me its
author's wisdom.  Other observations, however, came to clash with this theory.

First, since reading a book should have conferred me its powers, I should have
been able to *write the exact same book* after having finished reading it.  Yet,
it never was the case.  *Au contraire*: some books I would have difficulties to
explain or describe when asked.  As if reading the words was not enough to
really *comprehend* what they said.

This was the most evident when reading books whose contents were well out of my
reach.  I tried to push forward, reading each word but not *getting* them.  It
felt as if I was reading a text in an unknown language, even though it was all
written in my mother's tongue.  Maybe I was hoping that, when I finally got to
that last page, after clutching my way through the tortuous sentences and
unfamiliar jargon, I would be rewarded?  Hoping that, after having been seeded
by these fuzzy morphemes, some part of my brain would just *click*?  It is
difficult to know beforehand if some text is badly written, is intentional
gibberish, or if you are in fact not smart enough to make sense of it.

In time, I have learnt that reading requiring *some effort* on my part to
understand is a good sign: it's a signal that my brain is learning.  If I'm
cruising, then the material is certainly nothing new; if on the other hand I
struggle with each sentence, then the contents are probably out of my league
(for now).  There is a fine line, and I have to surf it.

But the final counterexample to that quaint theory was reading the same book for
the second time.  Surely, if one is supposed "gets" all the book by merely
reading it once, then reading it twice would be a clear waste of time.  Yet it
wasn't.  Even worse, when re-reading books I would find some *new* insights—not
just some leftover knowledge bits that I had previously missed, but insights
that *replaced* the ones I had gotten from previous readings.  As if I had
previously misinterpreted the book, and it was only now in this second reading
that I had attained its true meaning.

But it wasn't misinterpretation.  It didn't *feel* like misinterpretation.

### Helpful little lies

Books can only teach you what you read into them.  That sounds vacuous, but it
emphasizes one key point: the reader's own knowledge determines the outcome as
much as the sequence of words in the book.  There's an interplay between the
two.  My experience of reading *The Lord of the Rings*, and what I will retain
from it, may be vastly different from yours.

After reading some words off the page, the process of digesting them mostly
feels like a reorganization of thought.  The words need to be integrated with my
own mental organization.  It feels like introducing a stranger into some
long-standing fellowship.  There is an established dynamic that's clearly
working, and the stranger will have to learn that dynamic in order to fit in.
The same applies to these foreign-knowledge-bearing words.  Their concepts must
be adapted to the way my mental models are already set up.  And in doing so, I
my experience of reading the words is irremediably different than yours.

So there was the explanation.  If years had passed between my two readings of
the same book, its contents would still be the same, but *I* would have changed.
These intervening years are what changed my perception of the same words.  Much
like a source code is nothing without an interpreter, the reader is what gives
*meaning* to the book, and yet both components are necessary.

Thinking that the words alone bore all the knowledge was naive, even foolish.
It was a simple explanation—too simple, but one has to start somewhere.  We use
theories in order to make sense of the world, in order to survive.  Our theories
are like spiders' shells: once we outgrow them, we shed them and develop other,
more sophisticated and more nuanced theories which improve of the previous one's
shortfalls.  Shed after shed, our grasp on the world grows, ever-changing.  And
yet, we are only ever catching glimpses of the full picture.
