The larger topic is that any measure is diminishing (because focusing on one
axis is ignoring the other axis, and also ignoring what you don't measure), and
trying to judge people according to measures is fundamentally wrong-headed, and
has pervasice repercussions on society.


School grades are evil.  Why? Because they map a multidimensional work
to a linear scale, thus losing much information about the work in the
process.  Moreover, this mapping is more often than not unpredictable,
rendering comparison between grades -- one of their main selling point
-- totally useless.

words on the sustainability of the Smurfs economical model", and give
it to twenty students.  How should you grade their work?  Do you have
a definite angle you expect them to follow, or a list of key concepts
they should mention?  If so, do you fail a student who produces an
unexpected, yet pertinent answer?  If he is unable to show his
understanding of the concepts your class is concerned with,

### They'll game it anyway
