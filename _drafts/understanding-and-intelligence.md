# On Understanding and Intelligence

I don't believe in intelligence.  People often tell me "Oh I couldn't possibly
understand this, I'm not /that/ smart", to which I respond, sincerely, that I'm
not that smart either.  This is usually followed by a laugh, as if I made a
joke.  I wasn't joking, so let me explain.

I once studied Japanese at the university.  After three years, we had an informal
graduation ceremony in a small room.  Since we were only four students to receive
a diploma, it was more than enough.  One of our Japanese teacher was here, and
the professor heading the foreign linguistics department launched into a small
speech "Well, I'm sure glad to be here today.  I'd rather address successfull
students than teach or argue with bad students over their failing grades. I just
had a long argument with one of those ... it'js just hopeless.  Some people, they
should just flip burgers you know".  I cringed, very hard.

So I encounter more than a few people who believe that there are inherent limits
to what one can understand.  They tell me "I don't get math" or "I don't get
programming" or "I can't learn English.  I tried, really, but it's just not for
me".  Sometimes they affirm their impotence with pride "I have never ever
understood grammar, nor did I ever need it".

Well, as long as you don't /need/ to know math or programming or English or
grammar, then it's probably okay.  I guess most of the time, when someone tells
you "I don't get X", they are really saying "I have heard of X, but have no use
for it now and I don't think I ever will".  But, sometimes, they mean "Well, I've
tried to learn X as it could have been useful, but I couldn't make heads or tails
of it, so I just gave up since I was not cut out for it".

What's wrong with this line of thinking?  If you believe in inherent
discrepencies between brains, between "bright people" and the rest, between
"math heads" and "litterary types", how can you live your life?  What stops you
from believing in social castes?  Intelligence is not an aristocracy, and you
are not a serf.

  These bright people are therefore able to understand
more than the rest of humanity 

And when I say that I don't believe in intelligence, I put the emphasis on
/believe/.  I don't have any proof other than personal experience and observation.
There certainly are scientific studies on the matter, and I'm fairly certain
that we could find results arguing for both sides of the issue.  But in the end,
it doesn't matter.  I choose to believe that effort is the only requisite for
intelligence because the alternative is just not fun.  I love to learn stuff,
and I want to continue learning stuff.  If I put arbitrary roadblocks in my mind,
then at some point I will just give up saying "Nope, can't learn this, not now,
not ever.  Too bad, but what can I do about it?  It's who I am.  So I guess
that's it for learning for me.  Ok, what else is there?"
