title: Imaginary Property

Don't believe in it.

Nothing is created from the void.  Hence, ideas are never "original",
never anyone's own.  We are all the sum of our experiences, and
not much else.

So if everything is not anyone's own, how can anyone claim ownership on
anything?


Might separate posts:
- the myth of originality
- the consequence for intellectual property

The myth of originality:

Not a new idea (how ironic):

Though 'Everything is a remix' has a fatal flow: it looks like it's
trying to tell us that Star Wars was not original because it took
micro-scenes from a bunch of movies.  That's not the point I want to
make.  You need to go deeper: the movies and books that inspired Star
Wars were themselves inspired by X and Y and Z, which were themselves
inspired by ... and so on, until you lose track of the ancestry.

Every creation is the result of interactions in the complex system of
ideas shared between human minds, so you can't just put one name
below it.

The vision from Kevin Kelly is one that I share deeply :

```
Over the next century, scholars and fans, aided by computational
algorithms, will knit together the books of the world into a single
networked literature. A reader will be able to generate a social graph
of an idea, or a timeline of a concept, or a networked map of
influence for any notion in the library. We’ll come to understand that
no work, no idea, stands alone, but that all good, true and beautiful
things are networks, ecosystems of intertwingled parts, related
entities and similar works.”
