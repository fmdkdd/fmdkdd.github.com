title: My setup
---

There's this neat concept over at [The Setup][] where (more-or-less)
famous people describe their computer setup.  Every interviewee get
asked the same four questions:
- Who are you and what do you do?
- What hardware are you using?
- And what software?
- What would be you dream setup?

By browsing their answers, you can finally find out which hardware and
software help your personal heroes (or nemeses) conceive their great
works.  They usually list their day-to-day gizmos as well as their
invaluable instruments.

However, if you expect them to use life-changing tools you never heard
of, you'd better lower you expectations or you will probably be
disappointed.  Most of the hardware setups presented on the site are
merely a subset of the Apple product line.  Their software stack is
usually much more interesting, since they help solving specific
use-cases.  You may discover unsuspected gems which will end up
completing your own setup.

I wanted to describe my own setup for future reference, and since I'm
unlikely to be interviewed by the team behind the site, I'll answer
the questions right here.

### Who are you and what do you do?

I'm a CS student with a knack for languages.  My main activities are
learning and research; both are powered by reading and writing articles,
books and computer programs.

### What hardware are you using?

Although I have a desktop machine, nowadays I mostly use my [Vaio Z][]
laptop.  It's a fast, comfortable, elegant and very light machine.
All components are high-end.  The screen is gorgeous, with very
accurate colors, and a large 1600x900 resolution under 13"1 of matte
glass.  The keyboard is similar to those found in Apple products, and
it's my favorite keyboard yet: responsive and quiet.  Though my
standards might be a bit on the low end, since I've never tried a
mechanical keyboard.  The battery usually lasts around 4 hours with
WiFi on, which is sufficient for my current needs.  On the inside, it
hides a dual-core i5 M560 running at 2.67Ghz and 4Gb of RAM.  The
killer feature though is the 128Gb SSD.  I fear the speed upgrade it
brought made me less patient around computers running on hard disk
drives.

There are two downsides to this machine however.  The first is the
price.  Depending on the configuration, and especially if you add an
SSD, it can add up to quite a lot: the price range is $1600~$4500.
Looking at the competition, and after more than one year of daily use,
I don't regret buying it, but the investment is not trivial.  The
second drawback is the poor support of the NVIDIA graphics card under
Linux.  There are two graphics solutions: one integrated Intel
chipset, capable of playing video and modest games, and an NVIDIA
GT330M when more graphics muscle is required.  Switching between the
"stamina" mode and the "performance" mode works well under Windows,
but Linux only supports the Intel chipset.  Though I need to state
that every single other thing works like a charm under Linux, which is
laudable considering the sophistication of the hardware and the lack
of cooperation from Sony.  This last point alone has convinced me to
consider thoroughly all options before buying another Sony product.

My companion computer which lives in my pocket is a Samsung Galaxy
Nexus.  I'm happy with it for the moment, since it's fast and useful.
The display is large and comfortable to browse the web with.  I just
hope I don't have to replace it too soon, since these costly gadgets
tend to have a very short shelf life.

### And what software?

I've used [Ubuntu][] continuously since version 8.04 I think.  The
Debian package system works well, the system is stable, but more
importantly, everything just works.  No need to muck with drivers or
config files for things I don't care about.  WiFi, external monitors,
SD card and even the proprietary Memory Stick reader.  My laptop runs
Ubuntu 11.04 since the upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 broke a few things
I had to fix afterward, and I don't want to go through trouble again.

However, when I *do* want a fine-tuned configuration, I turn over to
the latest [Arch Linux][].  My previous laptop couldn't run the bloat
of a full-featured Ubuntu, so I took time going through the
[ArchWiki][] and related fora in order to build a more lightweight
system.  Since then, I've grown fond of this distribution.  The
rolling releases mean I don't need to upgrade the entire system to get
a new major version of specific software.  Once you get to know your
way around, the configuration is not so bad for desktops; exotic
peripherals can take some time to get working though.  I've heard good
things about [Gentoo][] as well, and might try it on a spare computer
when I find myself in a curious mood.

On top of this OS, my window manager of choice is [Xmonad][].  I've
used [Gnome][], [Unity][], and [OpenBox][] before settling on Xmonad.
The tiling paradigm aptly fits my work flow, and it liberates screen
estate from useless widgets.  Save for a thin status bar, the whole
screen is devoted to applications.  No longer do I have to move
overlapping windows out of the way.  All new windows get a share of
the current workspace, or their own workspace.  Xmonad is also deeply
customizable, though you need to be able to parse [Haskell][].

Growing up with a computer, I never took a good look at the keyboard
layout I was using, and just typed away until my fingers knew it by
heart.  It was only when my hands and wrists began to hurt after
repeated long typing sessions that I finally questioned the merit of
[AZERTY][].  Even though it's the *de facto* standard French layout,
there are letters in the French alphabet you can't type without the
help of additional software, like œ, or É.  In addition, pairs of
brackets, braces and parentheses are never side by side, which is a
pain when programming in most languages.  There are plenty of
alternative, carefully designed layouts you can choose from.  I
personally use [Colemak][], since it seemed easier to learn than
[Dvorak][], while being equivalently comfortable for typing.
Switching hampered my productivity for a few months, but was worth it
in the long run.

Aside from a keyboard and its layout, a good text editor is also
essential for typing greatness.  This is why my most cherished piece
of software is [Emacs][].  Obviously, I edit all source code with it,
and all my version control is done by using [Git][] from Emacs with
[Magit][].  I also manage my research notes and draft articles with
[Org mode][], read and write email with [Gnus][], navigate in projects
with [projectile][], [etags][] and [ack][], ...  I could write a whole
article to enumerate the ways I use Emacs and again another article to
describe my Emacs configuration file.

A well-designed monospace font is a primordial part of a programmer's
toolbox.  Again, there are many free, good-looking fonts suited for
programming to choose from.  Personally, I find the [Ubuntu Mono][]
font fantastic.  Before its release, I used the [DejaVu Sans Mono][]
from Bitstream, but the Ubuntu monospace variant has more charm and
perfect legibility.

My email setup is a tad convoluted, but for good reason.  I use
[Gmail][] for my main email address.  I use IMAP for all my email
accounts since I want to read my emails from my phone, laptop or
desktop machine.  In addition, I want to regularly backup all mail in
case any funny business arises in Google's headquarters.  Toward this
end, I copy everything with [OfflineIMAP][] to a local [Dovecot][]
server.  Then I use the already-mentioned [Gnus][] reader to compose
and read emails.  Nowadays I also read short emails or write quick
answers from my phone.

Apart from Emacs, the application I launch everyday is a web browser.
These days I'm back to [Firefox][] (trunk builds).  I have a battery
of privacy extensions, and can sync my bookmarks, history and open
tabs with other devices.  I used [Chrome][] for a while, but let it go
due to its smaller offering of add-ons and its annoying habit of going
to Google search instead of relying on browsing history. The speed
difference between these two is getting narrower, and the developer
tools are comparable.

The remaining programs deserving mention are: most of the
[GNU coreutils][], Gnome terminal, Evince and other [Gnome][] apps,
and [zsh][].

### What would be your dream setup?

My *truly* ideal setup would have the following characteristics:
- A large display I can read and write on for hours on end without straining my eyes,
- Talking, thinking and handwriting input,
- A way to conceive and develop programs without caring for minute details,
- No need to wade through a hundred pages of documentation to
  configure or fix something in the computer.

While this may be ideal, it might not be realistic, yet.  Though we
live in interesting times, and I do hope that someday I can tick a few
or all of these items.
