So, [Merwan][] and I made another game for [Ludum Dare][].  It had been two
years since our last entry, [You Are The MÃ¼nster](/yatm) (*YATM* henceforth),
which we had a really great time making.  Ever since, we have been meaning to
get together for another round, but never managed to align our schedules until
now.

You can play *Bright Plateau* [right here](/ld39).  The rest of this post is a
recollection of the 72 hours we spent making it, and may contain minor spoilers.

### Warming-up

In our timezone, the theme is announced at 3AM, in the night from Friday to
Saturday.  Merwan arrived Friday evening and, after we exchanged pleasantries,
we spent a few hours throwing ideas at each other, talking about games we liked,
why we liked them, what we thought they were lacking.  I remember talking about
simulations and tycoons, and how they can double as fun games, but also as
teaching tools for understanding complex systems.  These genres would come up
again later.

We went through the list of themes in the final voting round for this LD, which
at the time [was](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/theme/4):

> - Signal lost
> - Parallel worlds
> - Moving fortress
> - Running out of power
> - You are alone
> - Start with nothing
> - Machines
> - Running out of space
> - On / Off
> - Connections
> - Protect it
> - You are not the main character
> - 1 vs 100
> - It spreads
> - Different perspective
> - 1 HP

We liked "Moving Fortress", "Parallel Worlds", "Running out of space", "On /
Off", "Connections"; I remember discussing "You are not the main character" and
concluding it was a dead-end, on the basis that any mechanism we could find
would make the player-controlled character *the* main character in the eyes of
the player in the end.  We felt pretty good about "Running out of space"
winning, but we did not cast our votes, as we didn't even have accounts to the
new LD site at the time.

We then checked out a few of the top games from the last Ludum Dare for
inspiration:

![LD38 top games](/img/posts/ld38.png)

Out of these six games, we played: *Honey Home*, *The Deep*, *Super Kaiju Dunk
City* and *Snowed In*.  *Little Lands* looked awesome, but was Windows only, so
we skipped it.  For each game, we tried to understand its appeal, how they used
the theme to good effect, and summarized what we liked/disliked.

I showed Merwan another LD game I had stumbled upon
prior: [Twin Condition](https://jackrugile.com/twin-condition/).  I really liked
the clean aesthetic, the smooth animations, and the fact that you had to play
both part of the levels differently, but at the same time:

![Twin Condition screenshot](/img/posts/twin-conditions.png)

I also showed him [this prototype](http://rezoner.net/labs/spacesim.io/client/)
by rezoner, the author of [Playground.js](http://playgroundjs.com/) (among other
nice things); I liked the effectiveness and look of the low-resolution 3D
graphics:

![Rezoner space prototype screenshot](/img/posts/spacesim-proto.png)

Though unbeknownst to us, you can trace influences from *Bright Plateau* back to
these two games.

Then it was already 1AM.  For our previous LD, we stayed up until the theme had
been announced, started scribbling game ideas on paper, and went to bed only
after we had nothing further to write down.  This time though, we elected to
start off with a good night's sleep and to find out the theme in the morning.

### Finding the game idea

We woke up at around 9AM to discover the winning theme:

> Running out of power

Well, we quickly skirted that one the night before, as it hadn't inspired
anything to us.  But now the choice had been made.  We started throwing ideas:

![paper with game ideas for the theme](/img/posts/ld39-ideas.jpg)

We quickly gravitated to the idea in lower right: "Puzzle based around the power
grid".  Although at first it was much more elaborate than what we have now.

I remember pushing for a tycoon-like: there would be houses and plants to
consume power, and you would buy and put power generators on the map to supply
them.  The power consumers would have different consumption profiles: plants
would need a lot of power with low downtime, while houses would be consume
mostly in the day, but less at night.  The consumption would not be fixed, but
could vary from house to house.  The generators would *also* produce a varying
amount of power, depending on environmental conditions (wind for wind turbine,
sunlight for solar panels), maintenance, efficiency...  You earn money by
providing power to consumers.  Maybe this money would have been your score,
maybe it would have allowed you to upgrade your generators.  You can make out
some of that on the doodles above.

With our previous game, we had learned that it was quite tempting to aim for a
much larger game than we had the (time) budget to build.  In *YATM*, we had
planned for a large world with four areas, each guarded by a boss that would
be designed around the item kept in its area.  In the end, we only had two
areas, and zero boss.

This time around, we agreed to focus our design in order to have a game that
would feel whole.  Merwan argued that we *could* go with the simulation idea,
but we would have no idea whether it's fun to play until we get something
running on the screen.  By then, what if it's not fun?  Maybe we wouldn't have the
time to throw it away and design another game.  He pushed for simpler rules; less
simulation, more puzzle.  What if instead of houses and plants, we had only
houses?  What if, instead of money, you would have a simple goal: power all the
houses?  What if, instead of a varying power distribution, we had only a binary
state: on and off?

We thought about how that would work.  You would put generators on the map to
supply houses.  Each generator would supply power to all the houses in an area
around it, but it would also have a fixed distribution in time.  So, for
instance, the solar panel would power all the houses in a disc around it, but it
would have a 50/50 distribution over 24 hours: 100% in daylight, 0% at night.

![photo of generators distribution along time](/img/posts/ld39-power-distribution.jpg)

We tried to play with the idea in our heads.  Would that be easy to understand?
How would you play the game?  How would you visualize the constraint of
validating the power distribution over time?  It turned out that the time
distribution was equivalent to a distribution in another spatial dimension.  So,
instead of placing generators on a plane, you were really placing them in space.
But how would that work, exactly?  Placing objects in space on a 2D screen is
not the easy to grasp, even when accustomed.  Maybe display the time dimension
below, like in [Shenzhen I/O](http://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/):

![Shenzhen I/O screenshot](/img/posts/shenzhen-io.png)

Merwan suggested to simplify, again.  What if, instead of 24 slices of a day, we
had only two: one slice for the day, one for the night.  Then, we could show the
grid in the day, have a little sun floating in the sky, and you would pick up
the sun and drag to the right to see the grid at night.  At night, the coverage
of the generators would change, and to solve the puzzle you would have to solve
day and night simultaneously.

I pushed for having the day and night side-by-side, as I felt that going back
and forth between the day and night would make playing unnecessarily
frustrating.  Merwan argued that it might be difficult to explain to players the
sudden split between day and night.  But then again, finding out that you could
drag the sun away would not necessarily be more intuitive.  And having the day
and night portions side-by-side would probably be easiest to get right.  We
thought about potential ways to present this to the player, but did not find a
satisfying solution, and elected to review this once we had the game running.
In the end, we never reviewed it: the night levels are introduced without any
explanation, but so far no player has complained about not understanding that
they have to light all the houses on both sides to solve the level.

At this point, we felt this might be an interesting game: simple coverage alone
would be quickly boring, but solving coverage with two slightly different sets
of constraints?  A tricky twist!

### Prototyping on paper

We took this idea for a spin on paper before committing to code it.

What should the coverage for the generators be?  Again, we went for the simplest
thing we could think of: the solar panel would power a straight line, and the
wind turbine would power its immediate neighbors (in the final game, we did it
the other way around, as it felt more natural while playing).  I cut small lines
and crosses out of paper, and drew a few levels to get started:

![sketch of generators](/img/posts/ld39-paper-generators.jpg)

![level sketches on paper](/img/posts/ld39-paper-levels.jpg)

The number represent the amount of houses you have to power up.  Each generator
provides 1 unit of power to each tile it covers, so you have to overlap the
coverage area of multiple generators to supply power to tiles with 2 or more
houses.

In designing these levels, I went for the simplest non-trivial configurations of
lines and crosses I could find, then simply numbered *some* of the tiles covered
by the shapes.  Numbering all the covered tiles would have given away the
placement of the generators, and would have over-constrained the solution.
Solving the levels would have been easy and boring.  By not giving away too much
information, you leave the player guessing.  By not over-constraining the level,
you also let the player solve the levels in different ways, and that makes it
more interesting.  Although, you have to try to make sure there are no trivial
solutions that you didn't think of.

I handed these levels to Merwan, and he tried to solve them.  He got one very
quickly, and got stumped on another one.  "Are you sure there is a solution?" he
asked.  "I think so" I replied, and I thought: this is challenging, he looks
like he is having fun!  Then I double-checked, and as it turned out, my level
had no solution.  When I fixed it, he solved it quite easily.  I then made
another one, this time making sure it had a solution, and one that was not too
obvious.  He solved it in around 1 minute.  At this point, we felt that the
process of solving the levels was fun enough to go forward with this idea.

### Solving the night conundrum

An unresolved point were the rules of the night portion of the levels.  We
really felt like we *had* to have the night in there, as it would make the game
more unique.  But how exactly would that work?

Maybe the houses you need to power would not be the same at night?  Maybe, some
houses would only need power during the day, and some would need power during
the night?  We felt that would make the puzzles hard to design.  As we wanted to
display the day and night side-by-side, your generators would necessarily be in
the same place on the plateau in both sides, otherwise you wouldn't be solving
the same level, but really two separate levels.  So, we went for simple again,
and the houses you need to power would have to be the same on each side.

How to make the night interesting then?  We wanted to have a real interplay
between the day and night portions: you would have to go back and forth to
satisfy the constraints on both sides.  We needed to find a mechanism that would
let you solve the day side, but you would need to refine your solution in order
to solve the night side.  Solutions to the night side had to be a subset of the
solutions for the day side.

![sketch of night coverage for generators](/img/posts/ld39-paper-night-coverage.jpg)

We started by reducing the coverage of wind turbines and solar panels by half.
Now, we had to somehow overcome this power disparity between night and day.  We
thought about adding a third power generator that would work only at night.
What would be its coverage area?  We thought of a battery that would spread
power to neighboring houses.  Maybe we could charge the battery in the day, and
depending on the amount of charge, it would power that many houses?  If two
generators are powering it in the day, it provides two units power at night.
But how would we decide *which* houses would be powered by the battery at night?
If the battery has one unit of power, but two neighboring houses, which one is
powered?  And more importantly, how to communicate that rule to the player?  We
didn't know, so we changed it: what if the battery gives power to all the
neighboring houses, regardless of its charge?  That would be less annoying, as
you wouldn't have to care about the orientation of the battery.  The battery
would still need to be powered during the day, but receiving one unit of power
would be enough.  That made the day and night sides feel connected.

We did a quick check on the paper levels to see if the battery would still allow
you to solve the levels we had.  It wasn't clear at this time whether the
battery mechanism was interesting to play or not, but it was already 4PM, and we
ought to start coding at some point.

### Getting to a playable state

We both felt that an isometric view would be right for the game, and a very good
pretext to play with [THREE.js](https://threejs.org).  We threw together a
skeleton made of THREE.js and Playground.js (though we didn't use much of the
later in the end) and got to work.

I took care of the game logic: first a grid you could put things on.  Things
would be consumers, generators or obstacles.  A consumer would just be a number:
how many houses are on the tile.  A generator would have a coverage area, and we
would use that coverage in order to validate the level configuration: make sure
every consumer gets as many units of power as it requires.  Here is the first
iteration of the level validation code:

{% highlight js %}

let counters = new Map();
for (let th of this.things.keys())
  if (th instanceof Consumer)
    counters.set(th, 0);

for (let th of this.things.keys())
  if (th instanceof Generator)
    // Let the generator add to the power counters
    th.distributePower(this, counters);

// Gather any mispowered (unpowered/overloaded) consumer,
// with the current value
let mispowered = [];
for (let [counter, power] of counters.entries())
  if (counter.size !== power)
    mispowered.push({counter, current_power: power});

// If there are no mispowered consumers, the level is solved!
let solved = mispowered.length === 0;
{% endhighlight %}

I would revisit it later to have separate counters for the night as well, and to
handle the case of the battery distributing power at night only when powered in
the day.  But the principle remains the same.

For editing the levels, I simply represented them as strings in a JS file:

{% highlight js %}
let LEVELS = [
  {
    generators: 'SS',
    map: `....1.2...`,
  },

  {
    generators: 'SSW',
    map: `.....
          .....
          .221.
          .2.1.
          .....`,
  },
{% endhighlight %}

For *YATM*, we had used the [Tiled][] editor, and while it had its downsides, it
got the job done.  However, using an external editor, there is an extra
export step that gets in the way when you need to design levels quickly.

With the levels in a string, I just wrote a simple parser that emitted instances
of the relevant objects according to the current character.  It made editing
levels trivial, as I just had to change a few characters in a text editor and
reload the game to immediately see the result.  This allowed me to iterate on
the levels rather quickly on Day 3, when I put the bulk of the levels in the
game.

By the end of Day 1, we could load a level, move and place generators, and
the game could tell us whether the level was solved or not, and which tiles were
lacking power.  All of that in *the console*, not on the screen.  Merwan was in
charge of everything visual (he has the credentials for that), but we didn't
plug the view and the logic together until Day 2.

### Adding the visuals

Here are a few screenshots of the visual progress for the first two days:

![collage of several iterations of the game visuals](/img/posts/ld39-collage1.png)

Why are wind turbines floating in the air in the bottom two screenshots, you
ask?  This is the inventory that we cut from the game.  If you look back to the
level data higher up, you will see a `generators` line.  Initially, you were
supposed to pick the generators from the inventory area before placing them on
the plateau.  The code was a bit tricky to get right, as we needed to have a
separate render pass just for the inventory, and specific picking code since the
inventory would live in a separate world space.  Plus, we had extra logic for
dealing with taking things from the inventory and putting them back in it.  But
then, it occurred to me that we didn't *need* the inventory: we could just place
the generators directly on the plateau, and the player would simply move them.
It made the code simpler, and the game more intuitive!  I immediately told
Merwan, who agreed it was the right callâbut only after initially hating me for
cutting the feature he had spent the last two hours working on.

The lower-right screenshot shows the side-by-side day and night views working.
It was a bit simpler than anticipated to get working (THREE.js
had [example code][] for multiple views), but it was still tricky to get
everything right.  At first, we thought about duplicating the day scene into a
night scene and keep the two scenes in sync with the model.  Merwan suggested an
alternative of rendering the same scene, but changing a few parameters on the
fly.  For instance, lights could be toggled on and off, or switched directions
before rendering the night scene, and reset before rendering the day scene.
This worked nicely.

The tricky part was rendering the coverage area of the generators, as they were
actually different objects.  The feedback for powered houses would also
necessarily be different in both scene, as a house could be powered at day but
not receive any power at night.  We ended up rebuilding the coverage areas
*every time* we set up the day or night scene, that is, at 120Hz.  That is
grossly inefficient and keeps the garbage collector quite busy, but as we only
show the coverage for the currently highlighted generator, it has been an issue
in practice.  The feedback for powered house is less wasteful: it's simply a
list of objects that we give to an outline pass; we update this list before
rendering the day and night scenes.

At the end of Day 2, we had something playable, although with only 5 levels, and
the visual feedback was still rough.  We parted ways as Merwan had to travel
back home, and we kept hacking on the game remotely with regular updates over
the phone, right until the deadline.

### Day 3: night levels and polish

![second collage of several iterations of the game visuals](/img/posts/ld39-collage2.png)

The last day was probably the longest as we stayed up right until the deadline
to put everything we could in the game, and make a coherent whole.

Merwan worked hard on making sure the rules of the games were intelligible
through the visuals.  You can see in the collage above some iterations of the
coverage areas and visual feedback for powered houses: from orange tiles
signaling unpowered houses, to individual outlines around houses.

He worked on visual polish: the dust particles when you plop a generator on the
plateau, or making the day and night scene have a different feel, so it would be
obvious to players that it was, in fact, the same plateau at different times of
the day.  The sun and the moon were a nice touch on that front, but then the
shadow directions were all wrong, and we had issues the moon coming in front of
generators in the night scene.  We would have loved keeping them, but due to
lack of time, he cut them and opted for a starry background instead.  He still
took the time to put a *YATM* easter egg in the starts though!

I spent the day making the level validation work for the night levels, as we
settled on the exact behavior of the battery.  I then designed the night levels;
we still had only one.  I aimed for 3 night levels, as I wasn't really sure I
could stretch the idea without making the levels feel repetitive.  In the end, I
managed to make quite a few levels more!  I then spent around two hours making
the sound effects in [sfxr][] and the music in [Sunvox][].  I was quite
satisfied with the music, as the end result was about what I had in mind when I
started.

When all of this was in, I asked [Marie][] play the game from start to finish,
in order to get her first impressions.  Having a fresh set of eyes on the game
is crucial, as there are things that are obvious to the developers who have been
working on it from the start, but may not be to players who might not devote
more than 5 minutes to the game.  Her feedback helped me nail down the level
difficulty progression, and gave us a roadmap of things to improve in last hours
of the jam.

Ten minutes before the deadline, I hit the "Submit" button on the LD page.  We
called each other on the phone to pat each other's back on a job well done.  We
had made a game!

### Aftermath

It's a weird feeling, to know that three days earlier you had no clue of what
your game would look like, or if you would even be able to get something fun
working this time around.  But, three days later, we had a game we could show to
colleagues and friends.  The feedback on
the [LD page](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/bright-plateau) has also
been overwhelmingly positive.  It's a great feeling!

I would without a doubt recommend to anyone who has ever wanted to make a game,
to participate in a game jam.  I feel that it is a good way to learn how it to
focus your game design and coding efforts in order to make something playable
and complete.  It forces you to relentlessly cut, cut and cut, until you have a
core that is both fun enough *and* realizable.  This is quite different from the
greenfield development of side projects.

And even if you don't finish or submit your game, the experience itself is
something that is worth going through, and it will create memories that you will
gladly reminisce later down the road.  I know I will.
