title: Notes On A Thesis Defense
---

Tuesday was a very special day for my friend Karim.  He defended his
thesis.  After nearly five years of work, during which much teases and
jokes were made about his thesis pace (three years is the norm here),
he finally finished his dissertation and defended successfully.

It was also a very interesting afternoon for me, as I got to watch and
learn.  Especially, I focused on the jury's reactions during both his
talk and the following Q&A, as I was seated just behind the six of
them.  I also took note of specific points I think he got right during
his defense, and some others I would have done differently.

### [Focus on content, not on style](#focus_on_content_not_on_style)

Nearly everyone uses [Beamer][] at my University.  It's not
particularly a joy to work with, but it produces clean slides.  The
downside is, your slides tend to look the same as those of other
Beamer users.  It's particularly true when one doesn't take the time
to question the default [Warsaw theme][].  The blue and black color
scheme has become as tiring as Times New Roman for me, and I cringe
every time I see it. And I cringed when Karim launched his talk.

However, Karim quickly made me forgot the atrocious theme after two
minutes or so, because the _content_ was interesting.  The theme may
be ugly, but at least it's not distracting.

### [Only show what's relevant](#only_show_whats_relevant)

At one point, Karim showed us one of his algorithms on one slide.  An
entire, forty-something lines algorithm on just one slide.  In a talk,
a slide stays between one and two minutes on screen.  I can't
[_grok_][grok] a forty lines algorithm in two minutes.  Nevertheless,
I am able to get the gist of it if you highlight the relevant parts,
as Karim did.

Still, I would have preferred a high-level description of the
algorithm rather than the whole thing.  I can always check his
dissertation for the details.

### [State your point clearly, and hammer it](#state_your_point_clearly_and_hammer_it)

When you have the luxury of a one-hour talk, everyone should get your
main point, even your family at the end of the room who came to cheer
on you.  This is especially true of a thesis defense.  Everyone should
know your thesis, and how you tackled it.  Make one slide with only
your thesis on it, and show it a least three times during your talk.
Start with it, show it when you switch sections, and begin your
conclusion with it.  You _don't_ want the jury to ask you to state the
aim of your thesis during Q&A, so print it on a t-shirt just to be
safe.

### [Don't worry](#dont_worry)

Karim worked nearly five years on his thesis.  Of the two algorithms
he offered, one was developed in the last year, and the other he
developed over the last _six months_.  He spent the best part of four
years trying to come up with the _perfect_ model, and the _best
suited_ algorithm.  When he ran overtime, he settled on those two
algorithms and completed his thesis.  While not perfect, the end
result is still very interesting, and was enough to satisfy the jury
who awarded him his doctorate with the highest honors.

A thesis is just the beginning of an academic career, not its zenith.
Try your best, but stay away from _the_ best if you want to finish
someday.  You can always continue working on the subject after your
defense.

If you want to read more on the subject, Olin Shivers has
[some good thesis advice][olin], and Gian-Carlo Rota's
[_Ten Lessons I Wish I Had Been Taught_][rota] is a good read on
teaching and giving presentations.
