title: Programming languages names etymology
---

Do you ever wonder where the name of your favorite programming
language comes from?  I do.  The first to struck me was Python.

### Why Python?

At first we might associate it with the large, constricting snake,
star of many B-movies about people in beige shorts being swallowed
whole by not-so-mythological beasts.  The [official logo][3] strongly
indicates that this is the intended meaning behind the name.  The
actual origin has a more _British_ flair, as it comes from the Monty
Python's Flying Circus BBC show.  Quoting Guido van Rossum, the
language's author, in [Foreword to _Programming Python_][1]:

> Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby"
> programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around
> Christmas. My office (a government-run research lab in Amsterdam)
> would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my
> hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting
> language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that
> would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for
> the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of
> Monty Python's Flying Circus).

Jolly good!  As a testament to this ancestry, the literature
concerning the Python language often refers to Monty Python skits (see
the [official tutorial][2] for an example), but seldom mentions
reptiles.

### It's not a snake ... or is it?

But wait, where did the snake logo came from then?  There must be some
connexion, otherwise it would not ornate the official homepage to the
language. Guido van Rossum provides the answer in
[an interview with Computer World][4]:

> **Are you a Monty Python fan (given the name and other elements of the
> language derive from Monty Python's Flying Circus)?**
>
> Yes, this is where I took the language's name. The association with
> the snake of the same name was forced upon me by publishers who didn't
> want to license Monty-Python artwork for their book covers. I'm also
> into the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, though I'm not into much
> other staples of geek culture (e.g. no sci-fi or fantasy, no role
> playing games, and definitely no computer gaming).

So, Monty Python artwork licensing difficulties on Python books
introduced the association with snakes.  I guess the serpentine
imagery stuck, and ended up replacing the [legacy logo][5].

I wonder which publishers van Rossum refers to though.  Perhaps
[the publisher][6] of the aforementioned _Programming Python_, who
coincidentally happens to favor putting animals on their book covers.
In that case, the elegant compromise would have been to choose a
[dead parrot][7].
