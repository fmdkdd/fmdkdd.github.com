## About

![My face](img/me.png)

I'm a knowledge seeker who loves to learn, in order to gain a greater
understanding of myself and of the world around me.  And as I gain knowledge, my
ignorance widens, which in turn leads to more learning.

I'm principally interested in computer science and programming; I like to build
stuff in order to understand how things work, or just to tinker with an idea.  I
have a soft spot for emulators and games, but I also like learning programming
languages, algorithms, data structures, idioms, or tricks.  Beyond that, I like
reading, walking, biking and sleeping.

I'm a strong proponent of free software and open knowledge.  You can find most
of my stuff on Github, even the [source][] for this website.  Unless otherwise
noted, all content on this site is in the public domain ([CC-0][]).
