## About

![My face](img/me.png)

I'm a French problem solver who loves to learn, in order to solve
more.

I'm interested in the following subset topics of computer science:
programming, languages, algorithms, structures, idioms, tricks.  When
I'm not reading a book or a web article on one of these topics, I'm
most likely building something to scratch an itch, or just tinkering.
Or resting.  I do that too.  Beside walking, I also enjoy most forms
of modern entertainment: music, cinema, literature and gaming.

I'm a strong proponent of free software and open knowledge.  As a
testimony to that, you are free to browse, modify and reuse the

I'm currently completing a Master of Computer Science at the
[University of Le Havre][ulh], and globally having fun.
