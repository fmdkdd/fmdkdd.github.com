## About

![My face](img/me.png)

I'm a French problem solver who loves to learn, in order to solve
more.

I'm interested in most topics of computer science: programming,
languages, algorithms, structures, idioms, tricks.  When I'm not
reading a book or a web article on one of these topics, I'm most
likely building something to scratch an itch, or just tinkering.  Or
resting.  I do that too.  Beside walking, I also enjoy most forms of
modern entertainment: music, cinema, literature and gaming.

I'm a strong proponent of open source and open knowledge.  As a
testimony to that, you are free to browse, modify and reuse the
[source code for this site][source], which is powered by [Jekyll][].

I'm currently completing a Master of Computer Science at the
[University of Le Havre][ulh], and globally having fun.
