## About

![My face](img/me.png)

I'm a French problem solver who loves to learn, in order to solve
more.

I'm interested in most topics of computer science: programming,
languages, algorithms, structures, idioms, tricks.  When I'm not
reading a book or a web article on one of these topics, I'm most
likely building something to scratch an itch, or just tinkering.  Or
resting.  I do that too.

I'm currently completing a Master of Computer Science at the
[University of Le Havre][ulh], and globally having fun.
